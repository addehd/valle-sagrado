Set the Content-Type header to 'application/xml' and ensure proper XML formatting with appropriate lastmod dates.\n<info added on 2025-05-30T15:15:37.927Z>\nSuccessfully implemented dynamic sitemap.xml generation for comprehensive SEO coverage. Created a dynamic sitemap endpoint at src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.ts that fetches all active products and categories from Supabase, includes static pages with proper priorities, and generates valid XML sitemap format with proper lastmod dates from database and SEO-optimized change frequencies and priorities.\n\nAlso implemented a robots.txt endpoint at src/routes/robots.txt/+server.ts that directs search engines to the sitemap location, protects admin and API routes from crawling, allows important product and category pages, and sets a respectful crawl delay.\n\nThe implementation includes static pages with appropriate priorities (Homepage: 1.0/daily, Products: 0.9/daily, About/Contact: 0.7-0.6/monthly, Legal: 0.3/yearly) and dynamic content with proper SEO signals (products: 0.7/weekly, categories: 0.8/weekly) using real lastmod dates from database timestamps.\n\nAdded error handling with graceful fallback to static pages if database fails, proper caching headers (1 hour normal, 5 min on error), XML validation, and console logging for debugging. The implementation is ready for testing via /sitemap.xml and /robots.txt endpoints, validation with online sitemap validators, and submission to Google Search Console.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T15:15:37.927Z>",
