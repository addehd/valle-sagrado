# Task ID: 16
# Title: Fix Build Error in Production Deployment Process
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and resolve the build failure that's preventing successful production deployment, specifically addressing the "pnpm run build" command that's exiting with error code 1.
# Details:
1. Analyze the build logs to identify the specific error:
   - Check the console output for error messages, stack traces, and warnings
   - Look for common build issues like missing dependencies, syntax errors, or configuration problems
   - Identify which part of the build process is failing (e.g., TypeScript compilation, bundling, optimization)

2. Reproduce the error locally:
   - Run `pnpm run build` in a clean development environment
   - Verify if the error is consistent or environment-specific
   - Check if the error occurs with npm as well (`npm run build`)

3. Common issues to investigate:
   - Missing or incompatible dependencies in package.json
   - Environment variables required for production builds
   - TypeScript type errors that only appear during production builds
   - Import/export issues that may be masked during development
   - Memory limitations during build process

4. Specific fixes based on error type:
   - For dependency issues: Update package.json and lock files
   - For TypeScript errors: Resolve type issues or add appropriate type declarations
   - For build configuration issues: Modify build scripts in package.json or configuration files
   - For memory issues: Adjust build process to use more memory or split into smaller chunks

5. Implement the fix:
   - Make the necessary code or configuration changes
   - Document the issue and solution for future reference
   - Test the build process locally before pushing changes

6. Update build process to use npm if necessary:
   - If pnpm-specific issues are identified, modify deployment scripts to use npm instead
   - Update any CI/CD configurations to reflect the change
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are correctly installed with npm

7. Create a build verification process:
   - Add pre-build checks to catch common issues before they cause build failures
   - Consider adding a CI step that performs a build test before deployment

# Test Strategy:
1. Local verification:
   - Run the build process locally using the same command that failed (`pnpm run build`)
   - Verify that the build completes successfully without errors
   - If switching to npm, test with `npm run build` as well

2. Output verification:
   - Check that all expected build artifacts are generated correctly
   - Verify file sizes and content are appropriate for production builds
   - Ensure all static assets are properly included

3. Environment testing:
   - Test the build in a staging environment that mirrors production
   - Verify the build process works in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Test with different Node.js versions if version compatibility is suspected

4. Functional testing:
   - Deploy the built application to a test environment
   - Verify all key functionality works as expected with the production build
   - Test critical user flows to ensure no regression

5. Performance testing:
   - Compare load times and performance metrics with previous successful builds
   - Ensure build optimization is working correctly
   - Verify bundle sizes are appropriate and not unexpectedly large

6. Documentation:
   - Document the root cause of the build failure
   - Update build documentation with any new requirements or steps
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for common build issues
