# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Multi-Upload Receipt Processing System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a frontend and backend system for processing multiple receipts from a ZIP file upload, using OpenAI API for OCR and data extraction.
# Details:
1. Frontend Implementation (/fin route):
   - Create a drag-and-drop interface for ZIP file uploads using a library like react-dropzone
   - Implement client-side ZIP extraction using jszip library
   - Add progress tracking for batch processing

2. Backend API Endpoints:
   - Create /api/upload endpoint to handle file uploads
   - Implement /api/process-receipt endpoint for OpenAI processing

3. Server-side Processing:
   - Use sharp library for image processing and pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
   - Integrate OpenAI Vision API for OCR on images
   - Use OpenAI API to interpret extracted text and structure data

4. Data Storage:
   - Create a 'receipts' table in Supabase with columns: id, user_id, merchant, date, total, raw_text, processed_data (JSONB), created_at
   - Implement functions to store processed receipt data

5. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement try-catch blocks for all API calls and processing steps
   - Use a logging library like winston to log errors and important events

6. User Feedback:
   - Create a results display component to show processed receipts
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

Code example for OpenAI Vision API call:

```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);

async function performOCR(imageBuffer) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          { type: "text", text: "Perform OCR on this receipt image and extract the text." },
          { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageBuffer.toString('base64')}` } },
        ],
      },
    ],
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

7. Implement rate limiting and error handling for OpenAI API calls to manage usage and costs.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test ZIP file extraction function with various file types
   - Verify OpenAI API integration for OCR and text interpretation
   - Test database operations for storing receipt data

2. Integration Tests:
   - Upload a ZIP file with multiple receipt images and PDFs
   - Verify correct processing of all files in the ZIP
   - Check database for accurate storage of extracted data

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality with different file types
   - Verify progress tracking accuracy during batch processing
   - Ensure proper error messages for invalid uploads

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure processing time for ZIP files of varying sizes
   - Test system under load with multiple concurrent uploads

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify proper file type validation to prevent malicious uploads
   - Ensure secure handling of sensitive receipt data

6. Error Handling:
   - Test system behavior with corrupted ZIP files
   - Verify graceful handling of OpenAI API failures

7. End-to-End Testing:
   - Upload a ZIP file, process receipts, and verify correct display of results
   - Check email notifications (if implemented) for processed receipts

8. Accessibility Testing:
   - Ensure the upload interface is keyboard accessible
   - Verify screen reader compatibility for the results display

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Supabase database and tables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary database structure in Supabase for storing receipt data
### Details:
Create a 'receipts' table with columns: id, user_id, merchant, date, total, raw_text, processed_data (JSONB), created_at. Set up appropriate indexes and constraints.
<info added on 2025-06-07T21:11:51.576Z>
âœ… Database setup completed successfully!

Created:
- receipts_table_migration.sql with comprehensive table structure
- Receipt types in src/lib/types.ts (Receipt, ReceiptProcessedData, ReceiptStats, etc.)
- Receipt utility functions in src/lib/receipts.ts for all CRUD operations

Database schema includes:
- receipts table with all required fields (id, user_id, merchant, date, total, etc.)
- JSONB processed_data field for flexible storage
- Comprehensive indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data protection
- get_user_receipt_stats() function for analytics
- Automatic updated_at timestamp trigger

The migration file needs to be applied to Supabase before proceeding with API development.

## 2. Implement frontend ZIP file upload interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a drag-and-drop interface for ZIP file uploads and client-side extraction
### Details:
Use react-dropzone for the upload interface and jszip for client-side ZIP extraction. Implement progress tracking for batch processing.
<info added on 2025-06-07T21:15:03.992Z>
Frontend interface implementation completed in /src/routes/fin/+page.svelte with comprehensive features including drag-and-drop upload, ZIP file extraction via JSZip, support for JPEG/PNG/PDF files, real-time progress tracking, and responsive UI components. The interface includes visual feedback for drag states, progress bars, status indicators, error handling, and a receipt gallery. Client-side processing handles file extraction, validation, type checking, and batch upload progress tracking. Added dependencies include jszip, @types/jszip, and file-drop-element for enhanced functionality.
