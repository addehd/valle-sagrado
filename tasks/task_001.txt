# Task ID: 1
# Title: Integrate Stripe Payment Gateway
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Stripe checkout integration for secure payment processing in the Valle Sagrado e-commerce platform.
# Details:
The Stripe integration is already fully implemented in the codebase. We have now created a comprehensive mock Stripe system that allows for complete testing without requiring Stripe API keys.

Existing implementation includes:
- Stripe packages installed (@stripe/stripe-js and stripe)
- Complete checkout API endpoint (/api/checkout) with PaymentIntent creation
- Full frontend checkout page with Stripe Elements
- Order creation and confirmation flow
- Error handling and 3D Secure support
- Email confirmation system
- Mock Stripe system for development and testing

Mock Stripe system components:
- MockStripe class with payment intents, customers, and payment methods
- MockStripeClient for client-side operations
- Smart Stripe Loader that automatically detects if real Stripe keys are configured
- Mock Card Element Component that visually mimics Stripe Elements
- Updated Payment Intent API that switches between real and mock Stripe

Required environment variables (when using real Stripe):
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (server-side)
- PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (client-side)
- PUBLIC_BASE_URL (for payment return URLs)

This task can now proceed with testing using the mock Stripe system while we await the client's Stripe API keys for production implementation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the complete payment flow using the mock Stripe system
2. Verify the system correctly switches between mock and real Stripe based on environment variables
3. Test with various mock test cards (success, failure, 3D Secure)
4. Verify order creation in database after successful payment
5. Verify email notifications are sent correctly
6. Test error handling scenarios
7. Once client provides Stripe API keys, create a Stripe test account and repeat tests with real Stripe integration
