# Task ID: 6
# Title: Finalize SEO and Responsiveness Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive SEO optimizations and ensure perfect mobile responsiveness across all pages to prepare for launch.
# Details:
1. Implement dynamic meta tags for SEO
2. Create a sitemap.xml file
3. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for products

5. Perform final cross-browser testing

Dynamic meta tags in SvelteKit:
```svelte
<script>
export let title = 'Valle Sagrado';
export let description = 'Discover authentic Peruvian products';
export let image = 'https://vallesagrado.com/og-image.jpg';
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <title>{title}</title>
  <meta name="description" content={description}>
  <meta property="og:title" content={title}>
  <meta property="og:description" content={description}>
  <meta property="og:image" content={image}>
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
</svelte:head>
```

Structured data for products:
```javascript
<script>
export let product;

const structuredData = {
  '@context': 'https://schema.org/',
  '@type': 'Product',
  name: product.name,
  description: product.description,
  image: product.image_url,
  offers: {
    '@type': 'Offer',
    price: product.price,
    priceCurrency: 'USD',
    availability: product.in_stock ? 'https://schema.org/InStock' : 'https://schema.org/OutOfStock'
  }
};
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <script type="application/ld+json">
    {JSON.stringify(structuredData)}
  </script>
</svelte:head>
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate meta tags and structured data using testing tools
2. Test sitemap.xml generation and submission to search engines
3. Perform mobile responsiveness testing on various devices and browsers
4. Conduct accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
5. Perform final UAT (User Acceptance Testing) before launch
