# Task ID: 18
# Title: Configure Vercel to Use npm for Builds Instead of pnpm
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Vercel configuration to override the default build system from pnpm to npm, resolving deployment failures while maintaining pnpm for local development.
# Details:
1. Create a `vercel.json` configuration file in the project root with the following content:
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": {
        "installCommand": "npm install",
        "buildCommand": "npm run build"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Ensure the `package.json` file has the correct build script that works with npm:
   - Verify that the `build` script in `package.json` is compatible with both npm and pnpm
   - Check for any pnpm-specific features or commands that might need adjustment

3. Update the Vercel project settings in the dashboard:
   - Navigate to the project in the Vercel dashboard
   - Go to Settings > General > Build & Development Settings
   - Override the Framework Preset if necessary
   - Set the Build Command to `npm run build`
   - Set the Install Command to `npm install`

4. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`:
   - Check that there are no dependencies only installed via pnpm but missing from `package.json`
   - Verify that all dev dependencies required for the build are correctly categorized

5. If using a monorepo or workspace setup:
   - Adjust the configuration to account for workspace-specific settings
   - Consider adding a `.npmrc` file if needed to configure npm behavior

6. Document the change in the project README:
   - Explain that local development uses pnpm while production builds use npm
   - Include instructions for other developers to understand this configuration

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the configuration locally before deploying:
   - Run `vercel build --local` to simulate the build process locally
   - Verify that the build completes successfully using npm instead of pnpm

2. Deploy to a preview environment:
   - Push the changes to a feature branch
   - Verify that Vercel creates a preview deployment successfully
   - Check the build logs to confirm npm commands are being used instead of pnpm
   - Verify that the application functions correctly in the preview environment

3. Monitor the deployment process:
   - Watch the build logs in real-time during deployment
   - Confirm that the error code 1 from "pnpm run build" no longer occurs
   - Verify that all build steps complete successfully

4. Validate the production deployment:
   - After merging to the main branch, verify the production build succeeds
   - Check that all application features work correctly in production
   - Verify that subsequent deployments continue to use npm for builds

5. Test local development workflow:
   - Confirm that local development still works with pnpm commands
   - Verify that developers can still use `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` locally
   - Ensure the development experience remains unchanged

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create vercel.json configuration file [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a vercel.json file in the project root to override the default build system from pnpm to npm.
### Details:
1. Create a new file named `vercel.json` in the project root directory
2. Add the configuration to use npm for installation and build processes:
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": {
        "installCommand": "npm install",
        "buildCommand": "npm run build"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
3. Save the file and ensure it's properly formatted

## 2. Verify package.json build script compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Ensure that the build script in package.json works with both npm and pnpm by checking for any pnpm-specific features.
### Details:
1. Open the project's `package.json` file
2. Review the `build` script and any related scripts it might call
3. Identify any pnpm-specific commands or features (like pnpm-specific flags)
4. Replace pnpm-specific commands with npm-compatible alternatives
5. Ensure all dependencies required for the build process are correctly listed in dependencies or devDependencies
6. Check for any workspace-specific configurations if using a monorepo setup

## 3. Configure Vercel dashboard settings [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Update the project settings in the Vercel dashboard to ensure they align with the new npm-based build configuration.
### Details:
1. Navigate to the Vercel dashboard and select the project
2. Go to Settings > General > Build & Development Settings
3. Override the Framework Preset if necessary
4. Set the Build Command to `npm run build`
5. Set the Install Command to `npm install`
6. Save the changes
7. If using a monorepo, ensure the Root Directory setting is correctly configured

## 4. Test deployment with npm configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Deploy the application to verify that the npm-based build process works correctly on Vercel.
### Details:
1. Push the changes (vercel.json and any package.json modifications) to the repository
2. Trigger a new deployment on Vercel (either automatically via git integration or manually)
3. Monitor the build logs carefully for any errors related to the build process
4. Verify that npm commands are being used instead of pnpm
5. Check that the application deploys successfully and functions as expected
6. If errors occur, review the logs to identify and fix any issues with the npm configuration

## 5. Document the configuration in project README [done]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Update the project documentation to explain the dual package manager setup for local development and production builds.
### Details:
1. Open the project's README.md file
2. Add a new section titled "Build Configuration"
3. Explain that the project uses pnpm for local development but npm for Vercel deployments
4. Document the purpose of the vercel.json file
5. Include instructions for other developers on how to work with this configuration
6. Add any troubleshooting tips for common issues that might arise
7. If applicable, explain why this approach was chosen over alternatives
8. Commit and push the updated README
