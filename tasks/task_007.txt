# Task ID: 7
# Title: Restructure E-commerce Routes and Implement Dynamic Project Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Reorganize e-commerce routes into a dynamic project structure to support project-specific e-commerce functionality.
# Details:
1. Restructure e-commerce routes:
   a. Create a new directory structure: `src/routes/[project]/e-commerce/`
   b. Move existing e-commerce related routes (cart, checkout, products) into this new structure
   c. Update import statements and navigation links throughout the application
   d. Implement dynamic routing to handle project-specific e-commerce functionality
   e. Ensure that the new route structure works with existing admin interfaces

2. Update existing components:
   a. Modify product listing, cart, and checkout components to work with the new route structure
   b. Ensure that project-specific configurations are respected in relevant components

Example of a dynamic route structure:
```
src/routes/
  ├── [project]/
  │   └── e-commerce/
  │       ├── cart/
  │       │   └── +page.svelte
  │       ├── checkout/
  │       │   └── +page.svelte
  │       ├── products/
  │       │   ├── +page.svelte
  │       │   └── [productId]/
  │       │       └── +page.svelte
  │       └── +layout.svelte
```

Example of using the project parameter in a Svelte component:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { page } from '$app/stores';
  
  // Access the project slug from the URL parameters
  const projectSlug = $page.params.project;
  
  // Use the project slug to fetch project-specific data
  $: fetchProductsForProject(projectSlug);
  
  async function fetchProductsForProject(slug) {
    // Implementation to fetch products for the specific project
  }
</script>
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Route restructuring tests:
   a. Verify that all e-commerce routes are accessible under the new `/[project]/e-commerce/` structure
   b. Test navigation between pages to ensure all links are updated correctly
   c. Confirm that project-specific routes load the correct data

2. E-commerce functionality tests:
   a. Complete a purchase flow (add to cart, checkout, payment) for multiple projects to ensure project-specific functionality works
   b. Verify that product listings are correct for each project

3. Performance tests:
   a. Measure load times for e-commerce pages before and after the restructuring to ensure no significant performance degradation

4. Regression tests:
   a. Run existing test suite to ensure that the restructuring hasn't broken any previously working functionality
   b. Pay special attention to admin interfaces for product and order management

5. Cross-browser and responsive design tests:
   a. Verify that the restructured pages work correctly across different browsers and device sizes

6. Database integrity tests:
   a. Ensure that existing orders and products are still associated with the correct projects after the restructuring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create new directory structure for e-commerce routes [done]
### Dependencies: None

Implement logic to dynamically route e-commerce requests based on the project slug, ensuring that the correct project-specific components and data are loaded

## 9. Update e-commerce components for project-specific functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Modify product listing, cart, and checkout components to work with the new route structure
### Details:
Update all e-commerce components to extract and use the project parameter from the URL, ensuring they load and display project-specific data correctly

## 10. Ensure compatibility with existing admin interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.9
### Description: Verify and update admin interfaces to work with the new project-specific e-commerce structure
### Details:
Test admin interfaces for product and order management with the new route structure, making any necessary adjustments to ensure they function correctly with project-specific e-commerce data

## 11. Comprehensive testing of restructured e-commerce flow [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.9, 7.10
