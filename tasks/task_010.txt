# Task ID: 10
# Title: Add Title and Text Box to Start Screen with Visual Styling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a title and text box in the top left corner of the start screen with blur effect, opacity adjustment, and rounded corners to enhance visual hierarchy and branding.
# Details:
1. Create a container div for the title and text box positioned in the top left corner of the start screen.
2. Add an h1 element for the title with appropriate styling (font-size, font-weight, color).
3. Add a paragraph element or div for the text content.
4. Apply the following CSS styles to the container:
   - Position: absolute with appropriate top and left values
   - Background-color with opacity (using rgba() or opacity property)
   - Border-radius for rounded corners (e.g., 10px or 1rem)
   - Backdrop-filter: blur() for the blur effect (with appropriate fallbacks for browser compatibility)
   - Padding and margin for proper spacing
   - Z-index to ensure proper layering
5. Ensure the text remains readable against the blurred background
6. Make the component responsive for different screen sizes
7. Consider adding subtle animations or transitions for when the start screen loads
8. Ensure the styling aligns with the overall application branding guidelines
9. Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual inspection: Verify the title and text box appear in the top left corner of the start screen with the specified styling effects.
2. Cross-browser testing: Check that the blur effect, opacity, and rounded corners render correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
3. Responsive testing: Confirm the component displays properly on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
4. Accessibility testing: Verify the text is readable and meets contrast requirements despite the opacity and blur effects.
5. Performance testing: Ensure the blur effect doesn't cause noticeable performance issues, especially on mobile devices.
6. Unit tests: Verify the component renders with the correct props and styling.
7. Integration tests: Confirm the component integrates properly with the start screen.
8. User feedback: Collect opinions on the visual appeal and readability of the styled text box.
9. Validate that the styling matches the approved design specifications and branding guidelines.
