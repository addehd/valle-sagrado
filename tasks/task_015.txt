# Task ID: 15
# Title: Fix Build Error in Production Build Process
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and resolve the build failure that's preventing successful production builds, specifically addressing the "pnpm run build" command that's exiting with error code 1.
# Details:
1. Analyze the build logs to identify the specific error:
   - Check the console output for error messages, stack traces, and warnings
   - Look for common build issues like missing dependencies, syntax errors, or configuration problems
   - Identify which part of the build process is failing (e.g., TypeScript compilation, bundling, optimization)

2. Reproduce the error locally:
   - Run `pnpm run build` in a clean development environment
   - Verify the error is consistent and reproducible
   - Check if the error occurs in different environments (local dev, CI/CD pipeline)

3. Common issues to investigate:
   - Missing or incompatible dependencies in package.json
   - TypeScript type errors that only appear during production builds
   - Environment variables not properly configured for production
   - Import/export issues that might be masked during development
   - Memory limitations during build process
   - Path resolution problems specific to production builds
   - Issues with optimization or minification steps

4. Potential fixes:
   - Update package dependencies to compatible versions
   - Resolve TypeScript errors by adding proper type definitions
   - Fix import/export statements causing build failures
   - Adjust build configuration in next.config.js or similar files
   - Increase memory allocation for build process if needed
   - Fix environment variable configuration for production builds

5. After implementing fixes:
   - Test the build process thoroughly
   - Document the root cause and solution
   - Consider adding build validation steps to prevent similar issues in the future

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify build success:
   - Run `pnpm run build` and confirm it completes without errors
   - Check that the exit code is 0 (success) rather than 1 (failure)
   - Ensure all expected build artifacts are generated correctly

2. Test the built application:
   - Serve the production build locally using `pnpm start` or equivalent
   - Verify all major functionality works in the production build
   - Test critical user flows to ensure they function correctly
   - Check for any console errors in the browser when using the production build

3. Regression testing:
   - Verify that fixing the build error hasn't introduced new issues
   - Run existing test suites against the production build
   - Compare behavior between development and production builds

4. CI/CD validation:
   - Push changes to a test branch and verify the build succeeds in CI/CD pipeline
   - Confirm deployment processes work correctly with the fixed build

5. Documentation:
   - Document the issue and solution for future reference
   - Update build documentation if necessary
   - Consider adding specific tests or linting rules to catch similar issues earlier
