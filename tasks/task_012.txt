# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Service Type for Products
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service product type that behaves differently from physical products in the client interface, with custom display elements, booking flow, and checkout process.
# Details:
1. Create a new product type enum or flag in the product model to distinguish between physical products and services
2. Extend the existing product schema to include service-specific attributes:
   - Duration (time required for service)
   - Available time slots
   - Provider/staff member information
   - Location details (if applicable)
   - Cancellation policy

3. Modify the product display component to render differently based on product type:
   - For services: emphasize availability calendar, duration, provider details
   - For physical products: maintain current display with inventory, shipping options

4. Implement a booking flow for services:
   - Create a calendar/time slot selection component
   - Add provider/staff selection if multiple options exist
   - Implement booking confirmation with details summary

5. Modify the checkout process to handle services differently:
   - For services: collect any additional required information (e.g., special requests)
   - Skip shipping method selection for service-only orders
   - Adjust order confirmation to display booking details for services

6. Update the cart component to display service items with their booking details
   - Show selected date/time
   - Show provider/staff if applicable
   - Display cancellation policy

7. Implement proper validation for service bookings:
   - Prevent double-bookings for the same time slot
   - Validate service availability before confirming

8. Update relevant API endpoints to handle service-specific operations:
   - Booking creation/modification
   - Availability checking
   - Service-specific checkout processing

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Verify product type identification logic correctly distinguishes services from physical products
   - Test service-specific attribute validation
   - Ensure booking validation logic prevents scheduling conflicts

2. Integration Tests:
   - Confirm product display components render correctly based on product type
   - Verify booking flow correctly captures and stores all required information
   - Test that checkout process adapts appropriately for service-only, physical-only, and mixed orders
   - Ensure cart correctly displays service items with booking details

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Complete user journey for booking a service:
     a. Browse services
     b. Select service
     c. Choose time slot
     d. Add to cart
     e. Complete checkout
   - Test mixed cart checkout with both services and physical products
   - Verify order confirmation displays appropriate information for services

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test handling of service cancellations
   - Verify behavior when a service becomes unavailable after being added to cart
   - Test time zone handling for service bookings
   - Confirm proper error messaging for invalid booking attempts

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure load time differences between service and physical product pages
   - Test system performance with concurrent booking attempts for the same service

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend Product Model for Services [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing product model to include service-specific attributes and a type flag.
### Details:
Add a 'type' field to distinguish between physical products and services. Extend the JSONB 'attributes' field to include service-specific data such as duration, available time slots, provider information, location details, and cancellation policy.

Extended Product Model for Services

Implementation completed:

1. **Extended types.ts with service-related interfaces:**
   - Added ProductType enum (PHYSICAL, SERVICE) to distinguish product types
   - Created ServiceAttributes interface with comprehensive service-specific fields:
     - duration (minutes)
     - timeSlots (day of week, start times, max bookings)
     - providers (staff information and availability)
     - location (online, on-site, or customer location)
     - cancellationPolicy (refund rules and timing)
     - requirements (advance booking, max participants, required fields)
   - Added ServiceBooking interface for managing actual bookings
   - Added AvailabilitySlot interface for calendar availability
   - Extended Product interface with product_type and service_attributes fields

2. **Created comprehensive service utilities (src/lib/services.ts):**
   - isServiceProduct() and isPhysicalProduct() helper functions
   - getServiceAttributes() with backward compatibility for legacy format
   - getDefaultServiceAttributes() for new service creation
   - generateAvailabilitySlots() for calendar generation
   - validateAdvanceBooking() for booking rules validation
   - calculateCancellationRefund() for refund calculations
   - Time/date formatting utilities (getDayName, formatTime)

3. **Backward compatibility maintained:**
   - Supports both new service_attributes field and legacy attributes.service format
   - Graceful handling of existing products without breaking changes

The database can store service-specific data in the existing JSONB 'attributes' field, or we can add new columns for product_type and service_attributes. The current implementation supports both approaches.

## 2. Implement Service Product Display Component [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a new Svelte component to display service products with emphasis on availability, duration, and provider details.
### Details:
Develop a Svelte component that renders service-specific information differently from physical products. Include a calendar view for availability, highlight duration, and showcase provider details. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

Implementation completed:

1. **Created ServiceCard.svelte component** - A specialized display component for service products featuring:
   - **Service-specific visuals**: Different styling with blue gradient background for services without images
   - **Service badge**: Clear "Service" indicator to distinguish from physical products 
   - **Duration display**: Shows session duration (e.g., "1h 30m session")
   - **Location information**: Displays service location type with icons (üíª Online, üìç On Location, üè† At Your Location)
   - **Available days**: Shows abbreviated days when service is available (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)
   - **Provider information**: Shows service provider name when available
   - **Cancellation policy**: Quick summary of refund policy and timing
   - **Book Now button**: Service-specific CTA that navigates to booking flow with ?action=book parameter

2. **Enhanced ProductCard.svelte** with intelligent rendering:
   - **Automatic detection**: Uses isServiceProduct() to detect service vs physical products
   - **Conditional rendering**: Renders ServiceCard for services, standard ProductCard for physical products
   - **Seamless integration**: Maintains all existing props and functionality for physical products
   - **Import integration**: Added ServiceCard import and service utilities

3. **Service-specific features implemented**:
   - **Responsive sizing**: Supports small/medium/large sizes like ProductCard
   - **Project slug support**: Maintains project-based URL structure 
   - **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
   - **Image optimization**: Uses existing image optimization utilities
   - **Fallback handling**: Shows default service icon when no product image available

The ProductCard component now automatically detects product type and renders the appropriate display without any changes needed to consuming components. Services get rich booking-focused display while physical products maintain their existing cart-focused display.
